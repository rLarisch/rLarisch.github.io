AI researcher at the lab of Artificial Intelligence of Prof. Dr. Fred H. Hamker at the University of Technology in Chemnitz.

## Interests

My research interests range from the dynamics caused by inhibitory plasticity in spiking neural networks, over neuromorphic computing to transformer models in deep learning.
Or as a list:

 - Representation of input information in neural networks
 - Plasticity and inhibition
 - Spiking neural networks
 - Attention-based deep learning
 - Robustness of large language models
 - Neuromorphic programming

## Current Projects

 - Development of a system driven by a large language model that can automatically transcribe and summarize therapeutic sessions([more information](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/informatik/KI/projects/therabox/index.php)).
