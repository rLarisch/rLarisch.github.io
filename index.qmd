## Welcome!

My name is René Larisch and I'm a PhD student at the lab of Artificial Intelligence of Prof. Dr. Fred H. Hamer at the Technical University, Chemnitz.

## Interests

I'm interested in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hwo sensory representations can be encoded by them.
Especially the role of plasticity and inhibition drives me nuts.
