## Welcome!

My name is René Larisch and I'm a PhD student at the lab of Artificial Intelligence of Prof. Dr. Fred H. Hamer at the Technical University, Chemnitz.

## Interests

My research interests range from inhibition in spiking neural networks to deep learning networks.
They cover the following topics_

 - representation of input information in neural networks
 - plasticity and inhibition
 - spiking neural networks
 - attention-based deep learning
 - neuromporphic programming
