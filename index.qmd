## Welcome! 

Hello and welcome visitor!
My name is René Larisch and I'm a PhD student at the lab of Artificial Intelligence of Prof. Dr. Fred H. Hamker at the University of Technology in Chemnitz.

## Interests

My research interests range from the dynamics caused by inhibitory plasticity in spiking neural networks, over neuromorphic computing to transformer models in deep learning. 
Or as a list:

 - Representation of input information in neural networks
 - Plasticity and inhibition
 - Spiking neural networks
 - Attention-based deep learning
 - Neuromorphic programming
